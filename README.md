[Hanabi](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi) is a boardgame designed by [Antoine Bauza](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/9714/antoine-bauza).

In a nutshell, this is a cooperative game with imperfect information, meaning that most of the move and choices players made can only be based on speculations and implications.  

This project aim to create the logic of the entire game, implement the interface using pygame, and finally design and train an AI model to play this game.  

This project is inspired by the paper [The Hanabi Challenge: A New Frontier for AI Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00506)
According to the result in the paper, a normal person who played just a while could obtain same performace as an AI. Since it is hard for AI to deduce concrete ideas and logics basic on incomplete information and uncertainty.  
And this project is trying to recreate the experiment and see if there's any better solution.  

# What's Next?  
So far we have sucessfully implemented the game logic using python. And the pygame interface development is ongoing.
