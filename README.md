# hanabi simulator
[Hanabi](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi) is a boardgame designed by [Antoine Bauza](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/9714/antoine-bauza). You may also check the detailed rules [here](https://rnrgames.com/Content/RRGames/images/ProductRules/hanabiRules.pdf)  


In a nutshell, this is a cooperative game with imperfect information, meaning that most of the moves and choices players make can only be based on speculations and implications.  

This project aims to create the logic of the entire game, implement the interface using Pygame, and finally design and train an AI model to play this game.  

This project is inspired by the paper [The Hanabi Challenge: A New Frontier for AI Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00506)
According to the result in the paper, a normal person who played just a while could obtain the same performance as an AI. Since it is hard for AI to deduce concrete ideas and logic based on incomplete information and uncertainty.  


And this project is trying to recreate the experiment and see if there's any better solution.  

# What's Next?  
So far we have successfully implemented the game logic using Python. And the Pygame interface development is ongoing.
